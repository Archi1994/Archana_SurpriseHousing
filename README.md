# Surprise Housing Assignment
Problem Statement: A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
In Assignment we are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
